{: .warning }
> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the HM Docs theme. See [the Changelog]({% link changelog.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes.

Just the HM Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the HM Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme.

## Getting started

{: .note }
To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the main branch of the [Just the HM Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the HM Docs.

The minimum that you need to run the theme are the [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/humanmade/just-the-hm-docs/blob/starter-theme/_config.yml) file and the [`Gemfile`](https://github.com/humanmade/just-the-hm-docs/blob/starter-theme/Gemfile).

However, the [starter theme branch](https://github.com/humanmade/just-the-hm-docs/tree/starter-theme) includes:

- additional markdown files with sample content to get you started
- a gitignore file, 404 template, and HM logo
- a [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

{: .important-title }
> Get started
>
> To get started with these files, just download the [starter theme branch](https://github.com/humanmade/just-the-hm-docs/tree/starter-theme) and place the files in a `/docs/` folder inside your own repo. 

## Working locally

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^2] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages if desired.
