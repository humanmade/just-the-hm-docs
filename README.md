# Just the HM Docs

Just the HM Docs is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying documentation for Human Made open source projects. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- [announcements](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/announcements.md)
- an [introduction](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/introduction.md) page
- a [feature](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/features.md) list
- [guides](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/guides.md)
- [modules](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/modules.md)
- and a [changelog](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/changelog.md)

Just the HM Docs is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/docs/navigation-structure)
- instant, full-text [search](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/docs/search) and page indexing
- and a set of [UI components](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://humanmade.github.io/just-the-hm-docs/docs/utilities)
