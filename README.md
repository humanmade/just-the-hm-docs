# Just the HM Docs

Just the HM Docs is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying documentation for Human Made open source projects. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- an [introduction](introduction.md) page,
- a [feature](features.md) list,
- [guides](guides.md),
- [modules](modules.md),
- and a [changelog](changelog.md).

Just the HM Docs is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

Just the HM Docs is also inspired by the [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class) extension of the Just the Docs theme.
