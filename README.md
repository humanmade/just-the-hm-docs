# Just the HM Docs

Just the HM Docs is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying documentation for Human Made open source projects. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- an [introduction](introduction.md) page,
- a [feature](features.md) list,
- [guides](guides.md),
- [modules](modules.md),
- and a [changelog](changelog.md).

Just the HM Docs is a fork of the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) Jekyll theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the HM Docs includes features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](docs/navigation-structure),
- instant, full-text [search](docs/search) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](docs/utilities).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the HM Docs is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the HM Docs](https://github.com/humanmade/just-the-hm-docs/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your project information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your project docs website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages.
